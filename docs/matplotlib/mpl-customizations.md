You can customize every aspect of Matplotlib according to your needs and likes.
If you want to apply certain set of styles universally, you can edit the
`matplotlibrc` file. In macOS, the files resides in
`/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/lib/python3.7/site-packages/matplotlib/mpl-data/matplotlibrc`.
The path may differ depending on your installation type and operating system.
You can edit the file there, but the problem is it will be overwritten if you
upgrade matplotlib. To avoid overwriting, copy the file to
`~/.matplotlib/matplotlibrc` and edit under your home directory. The
`matplotlibrc` file locations maybe different depending on the operating system.
You can get a copy of sample `matplotlibrc` file [here](
https://matplotlib.org/tutorials/introductory/customizing.html#matplotlibrc-sample).

Unfortunately, some settings are not correctly applied while using
`%matplotlib inline` in Jupyter notebook. Settings we need to apply in the
Jupyter notebook:

```python
plt.rcParams["figure.figsize"] = (8, 6)
plt.rcParams["figure.dpi"] = 150
```

### Alternative backend
If you want interactive plots, like ability to zoom, pan, read cursor position
etc., you can use notebook backend in your jupyter notebook:

```python
%matplotlib notebook
```

There are also Qt based backend that can show plot on it's own window and allows
more interactivity.

### Overriding default colors
```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline
plt.rcParams["figure.dpi"]=150
plt.rcParams["figure.facecolor"]="white"

color = ['#CD6155','#808B96','#9B59B6','#99A3A4','#7D6608',\
         '#F39C12','#2980B9','#16A085','#ABEBC6','#AED6F1']

x = np.linspace(0, 4*np.pi, 100)

for i in range(10):
    plt.plot(x, (i+1)*np.sin(x))
plt.show()
```
